A 2D gravity-switching game that is developed using Phaser.


## About this game
<p align="justify">
    This game has four levels, and the player must complete the first three levels before moving on to the 
    fourth level. For the first three levels of this game, the player may earn points by approaching and 
    touching the game physics formula icons that appear on the screen. In level 1, the icons are worth 10 
    points each, and the points will increase by 20 as the levels progress. After completing the first three 
    stages, the player will go to the fourth level, which challenges them to grab the falling trophy without 
    getting squashed. When the player succeeds, they will be redirected to a scene that says "You Win," and 
    they will be able to restart the game by hitting the 'R' button.
